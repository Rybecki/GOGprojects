- Changelog is not working: couldn't load changelog file /pl-PL.html

- Problem with installing games via GOG Galaxy: when clicking Library->All My Games-> and trying 
to install any game I can see the window where I can choose the language
and destination folder, then click Continue and get crash. GalaxyClient Crash Reporter shows up.

- Can't change the Client language (Client in english, even if I set it to polish)
Only Account Management section was in polish.
